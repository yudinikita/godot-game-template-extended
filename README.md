## ‚ùì FAQ

Here you will find the most frequently asked questions relating to the project answered.

<details>
  <summary>How can I change the scene?</summary>

  To modify scenes, you can leverage the power of the `SceneManager` global class. This class provides comprehensive functionality for managing scene-related operations. For detailed instructions and usage examples, please refer to the extensive documentation available for the addon.

  ```gd
  SceneManager.change_scene(scene: String or PackedScene or Node, fade_out_options: Options, fade_in_options: Options, general_options: GeneralOptions)
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can I change the scene using a loading scene?</summary>

  To utilize a loading scene for changing scenes, you need to create the loading scene first. Here's an example of the code to create the loading scene:

  ```gd
  extends Control

  @onready var progress: ProgressBar = find_child("Progress")
  @onready var progress_label: Label = find_child("ProgressLabel")

  func _ready():
    SceneManager.load_percent_changed.connect(Callable(self, "percent_changed"))
    SceneManager.load_finished.connect(Callable(self, "loading_finished"))
    SceneManager.load_scene_interactive(SceneManager.get_recorded_scene())

  func percent_changed(number: int) -> void:
    progress.value = number

  func loading_finished() -> void:
    loading.visible = false
    next.visible = true

  func _on_next_button_up():
    SceneManager.change_scene_to_loaded_scene(fade_out_options, fade_in_options, general_options)
  ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can I skip the start bootsplash?</summary>

  By default, the start bootsplash can be skipped by clicking anywhere on the screen. This functionality is enabled by default to provide a seamless user experience. If you wish to disable the start bootsplash completely, you can customize this behavior in the project settings or the relevant code section. Make the necessary modifications to ensure that the start bootsplash is skipped without requiring any user interaction.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can I skip or speed up the credits?</summary>

  To skip or speed up the credits, you can utilize the keyboard arrow keys. Pressing the up arrow key will accelerate the credits, while pressing the down arrow key will slow them down. This functionality is implemented through the ui_up and ui_down events, which are initially configured in the Credits settings. If you wish to customize this behavior, you can modify the corresponding scene to define your desired key mappings or adjust the speed settings according to your preferences.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>How can I display the game's version number?</summary>

  To display the version number of your game, you can refer to the project/version.gd file. This file contains the version constants that define the current version of your game.

  Here is an example function that retrieves the game version:

  ```gd
  static func get_version() -> String:
    var v = load("res://version.gd")
    return "v{major}.{minor}.{patch}".format(
      {"major": str(v.MAJOR), "minor": str(v.MINOR), "patch": str(v.PATCH)}
    )
  ```

  By using this function, you can retrieve the game version and display it in your user interface or wherever it's needed within your game.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I use this template for both 2D and 3D games?</summary>

  Of course. This template is designed to be versatile and flexible, allowing you to create both 2D and 3D games. It has intentionally been kept open-ended to support a wide range of game development needs. Whether you're working on a 2D side-scroller, a 3D action-adventure, or anything in between, this template provides a solid foundation for your game development journey. So go ahead and unleash your creativity in either 2D or 3D, the choice is yours.
